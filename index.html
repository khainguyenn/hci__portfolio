					<h2 class="major">Design Manifesto</h2>
					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					<p>
						As part of Davidson College’s first <em>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</em> course, I was
						excited to explore a new horizon in computer science. Over three transformative months, I
						ventured into a field previously unfamiliar to me—HCI.
					</p>
					<p>
						Before this course, my work centered on coding functionalities, often overlooking the critical
						role of <strong>user-centered design</strong>. HCI expanded my perspective, emphasizing the
						importance of designing intuitive and accessible systems that meet users' needs. From crafting
						website designs and conducting user research to developing immersive VR prototypes and applying
						advanced data visualization techniques, this class closely mirrored professional HCI practices.
					</p>
					<p>
						To synthesize what I’ve learned, I present this design manifesto outlining <strong>five key
							principles</strong> that shaped my design process. These principles aim to ensure that
						designs are not only functional but also useful, accessible, and deeply attuned to the needs of
						their end users.
					</p>

					<h2>POINT 1: Understand Users: The Foundation of Human-Centered Design</h2>
					<h3>Lesson 1: Understanding User Personas Enhances Personalization</h3>
					<p>
						One of the most impactful lessons I learned in HCI was the value of <em>user personas</em> in
						guiding personalized design decisions. During the Knotty and Board website redesign, our team
						created three distinct personas—Priscilla, Petra, and August—each with unique needs. For
						example, Priscilla, a 45-year-old designer, valued efficiency and preferred curated grids of
						furniture sets, while Petra, a 72-year-old, needed large, high-resolution images to showcase
						authenticity and quality. August, a 23-year-old pet owner, appreciated prominently featured
						pet-friendly furniture options.
					</p>

					<p>
						To create these personas, we used <em>empathy mapping</em> and <em>needfinding methods</em>, as
						outlined in <a href="https://hci.stanford.edu/courses/cs147/2021/wi/readings/FIELDGUIDE-Screen-DTBC-March-2015-V2.pdf" target="_blank">The Empathy Fieldguide</a>. This approach helped us identify pain points
						and tailor solutions to serve users’ needs and individual contexts effectively. The process
						demonstrated that personas are not static descriptions but highly practical tools to steer the
						design process based on user behaviors and goals.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Takeaway:</strong> Personas ensure designs are personal and relevant, bridging the gap
						between technical functionality and emotional engagement.
					</p>

					</div>
					<h3>Lesson 2: Prioritizing Parameters Based on User Needs</h3>
					<p>
						In the <em>Mental Health Visualization</em> project, I learned how to prioritize data to meet
						diverse user needs effectively. The dataset included variables like sleep, GPA, exercise, and
						stress. By focusing on three key groups—educators, parents, and students—we identified what each
						group valued most. Educators wanted insights on stress and performance, parents focused on sleep
						and academic success, and students looked for actionable ways to improve well-being.
					</p>
					<p>
						Using principles from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nQvmNzbUI3KnNwkuFJlBy6Q8O51kJqxu/view" target="_blank">The Design of Everyday Things</a>
						, we designed intuitive,
						accessible visualizations, normalizing parameters into "low," "medium," and "high" categories
						with color-coded indicators. This iterative process, guided by defining and ideating, allowed us
						to create visualizations that addressed diverse needs while simplifying complex data.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Takeaway:</strong> Prioritizing user needs ensures that designs are approachable,
						impactful, and aligned with stakeholder goals.

					<h2>POINT 2: Prioritizing and Creating Features Based on Screen Real Estate</h2>
					<h3>Lesson 1: Adapting Content for Limited Real Estate (Smartwatch Design - Knotty and Board)</h3>
					<p>
						Designing for small screens like smartwatches requires prioritizing essential features to avoid
						overwhelming users. For the Knotty and Board smartwatch app, we focused on two key tasks:
						accessing the shopping bag and tracking orders. These practical features addressed immediate
						user needs and ensured simplicity.
					</p>
					<p>
						We also utilized the smartwatch’s spinning crown for scrolling and screen switching, a critical
						adjustment for small screens where touch-based navigation can be challenging for users with
						larger hands. By aligning features with the device's hardware, we created a streamlined
						experience that worked seamlessly within the smartwatch’s constraints.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Takeaway:</strong> When designing for small screens, prioritize quick, essential tasks
						and leverage hardware features to enhance usability and avoid cluttered interfaces.
					</p>

					<h3>Lesson 2: Leveraging Expansive Space for Enhanced Engagement (Large Multi-Touch Display - Knotty
						and Board)</h3>
					<p>
						Large screens allow for high-quality visuals and intuitive content organization. In the Knotty
						and Board multi-touch display design, we divided the screen into modules: the central section
						showcased product images in a swipeable carousel, while sidebars housed customer testimonials
						and add-on deals. This layout utilized the space effectively, balancing engagement with clarity.
					</p>
					<p>
						In our <em>Design for Another World</em> project, we extended these principles to VR,
						integrating <strong>4D visualization</strong> that combined spatial, temporal, and interactive
						elements. For the VR Meditation Room, each environment (desert, forest, mountain) focused on
						soothing visuals and complementary ambient sounds, creating a fully immersive experience.
						Compared to traditional flat-screen designs, VR required rethinking layout and sensory feedback
						to prioritize engagement without overwhelming users.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Takeaway:</strong> For large or immersive displays, leverage space creatively to
						highlight key content and balance complexity with simplicity to maintain usability and
						engagement.
					</p>

					<h2>POINT 3: Carefully Consider Tradeoffs When Making Design Decisions</h2>
					<h3>Lesson 1: Prioritize Simplicity to Maintain Usability</h3>
					<p>
						A key insight from the <em>VR Meditation Room</em> project was the importance of simplicity in
						interaction design. Initially, we planned to use a single-button navigation system, where all
						actions—selection, navigation, and confirmation—are controlled by a single input. While
						innovative, this approach proved impractical on mobile VR platforms like Google Cardboard, which
						lacked precise input capabilities. According to Don Norman in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nQvmNzbUI3KnNwkuFJlBy6Q8O51kJqxu/view" target="_blank">The Design of Everyday Things</a>, simplifying interactions can reduce cognitive load and improve usability,
						particularly for novice users.
					</p>
					<p>
						To address this, we pivoted to a gaze-based navigation system, allowing users to interact with
						the virtual environment simply by focusing on objects. This adjustment removed unnecessary
						complexity and ensured the experience was intuitive and accessible, especially for first-time VR
						users.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Takeaway:</strong> Prioritizing simplicity over advanced functionality creates more
						inclusive designs and lowers barriers to entry for new users.
					</p>

					<h3>Lesson 2: Balance Functionality with Constraints for Feasibility</h3>
					<p>
						In the <em>Mental Health Visualization</em> project, we initially envisioned an intricate,
						multidimensional model to represent the relationships between CGPA, sleep, exercise, and mental
						health. However, the complexity risked overwhelming users and exceeded our technical and time
						resources.
					</p>
					<p>
						Instead, we simplified the visualization by normalizing data to a 0–10 scale and using
						color-coded blocks to represent dimensions. This design focused on clarity while retaining key
						insights, striking a balance between ambition and feasibility. The result was a model that
						delivered meaningful information in a user-friendly format.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Takeaway:</strong> Simplifying a design while maintaining its core functionality ensures
						usability and keeps the project within scope, especially under constraints.
					</p>
					<p>
						Both projects highlighted the importance of balancing functionality and usability by carefully
						weighing tradeoffs. By prioritizing essential features and adapting to technical constraints, we
						created designs that remained meaningful and accessible. This strategic focus on simplicity
						allowed us to deliver high-quality user experiences without compromising clarity or
						effectiveness.
